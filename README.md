## Description

### Why I created this project

I wanted a shopping list app like this because I used to use the default note app on my smartphone to make lists when shopping.  
And I wanted to make a simple application using typescript because I had only made pure reactapp.  
I thought that creating a simple CRUD app like this was a good opportunity to try the test code.

### What problem this app solved

Avoid missing anything to buy.
You don't need to use paper or note app.

### what I learned through this project

I reviewed how to create web application with TypeScript. Errors occurred several times when passing props, because I forgot to define interfaces. I felt I need to create more projects to get used to TypeScript. It was also a good review of testing with Jest.  
For use on mobile devices, the item list was designed to be in edit mode by simply clicking on it.ã€€ This has complicated state management. When adding a new item, the state was changed by clicking on another item, so I created state for switching to edit and add new mode
